## **Product Requirements Document (PRD): "Grok Heavy" Multi-Agent AI System**

### **1. Document Information**

*   **Product Name:** Grok Heavy
*   **Version:** 1.1
*   **Date:** July 12, 2025
*   **Status:** Consolidated Draft
*   **Description:** This PRD outlines the requirements for building the "Grok Heavy" multi-agent AI system. The system will be implemented in Python without relying on out-of-the-box agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI). It will use standard Python libraries for parallelism and custom logic for agent coordination, leveraging the OpenRouter API to access multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) like xAI's Grok, with reasoning effort set to "high" where supported.

### **2. Executive Summary**

Grok Heavy is a multi-agent AI system designed to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and creativity of AI responses. It achieves this by deploying multiple, diverse AI agents in parallel to independently process a user's prompt. These agents then collaborate through a structured deliberation process to refine their collective outputs and form a single, high-quality consensus answer.

Inspired by recent xAI advancements, research on AI-mediated deliberation, and community-driven ideas, this system directly tackles common LLM weaknesses such as hallucinations, bias, and single-model blind spots.

**Key Differentiators:**
*   **Framework-Free Implementation:** Built from the ground up in Python for maximum transparency, control, and learning value.
*   **Parallel Consensus-Building:** Leverages concurrent processing to generate a more robust answer than any single agent could produce.
*   **Extensible and Open-Source:** Designed for easy integration of new models and tools, with the goal of fostering a collaborative community.

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will feature a Supervisor-Worker architecture with 2-3 agents, basic tool integration, and a straightforward deliberation mechanism, initially targeting AI developers and researchers.

*   **Parallel Processing:** Use Python's `multiprocessing` or `asyncio` libraries for concurrent agent execution.
*   **Basic Tools:** Initial integration for:
    *   **Web Search:** Using a free, public API (e.g., DuckDuckGo).
    *   **Code Execution:** Using Python's `subprocess` or `eval` within a secure, sandboxed environment.
*   **Simple Deliberation:** A voting/scoring mechanism to select the best response or a supervisor-led synthesis of the top outputs.
*   **Interface & Logging:** A command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction and JSON-formatted logs detailing the deliberation process.

*   Advanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for deliberation.
*   Dynamic agent scaling based on task complexity.
*   A persistent user feedback loop for automated system improvement.
*   Integration with premium, paid tool APIs.

### **6. Features and Functional Requirements**

#### **Feature 1: Supervisor Agent**
*   **Description:** The central orchestrator that manages the entire workflow from input to output.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Must parse user prompts from CLI arguments.
    *   Must distribute the same task to all configured worker agents in parallel.
    *   Must monitor agent status and handle failures gracefully (e.g., timeout after 60 seconds, proceeding with results from remaining agents).
    *   Must collect all intermediate outputs for the deliberation phase.
*   **Implementation Notes:** Implement as a Python class. Use `asyncio` with `aiohttp` for non-blocking, parallel API calls.

#### **Feature 2: Worker Agents**
*   **Description:** Independent processes that generate responses using assigned LLMs and tools.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Each worker must be configurable with a specific OpenRouter model ID.
    *   Must correctly format and send requests to the OpenRouter API, including the `"reasoning": {"effort": "high"}` parameter for supported models.
    *   Must be able to parse the LLM's output to identify if a tool needs to be used (e.g., by detecting structured tags like `<tool>web_search</tool>`).
    *   Must return its final response along with a log of any tools used.
*   **Implementation Notes:** Each worker will be a function or class instance. API interaction will be handled via the `aiohttp` client session passed from the supervisor.

#### **Feature 3: Tool Integration**
*   **Description:** A simple, extensible toolkit that agents can use to gather external information or perform computations.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   The system must provide a `web_search(query)` tool and a `code_executor(code)` tool.
    *   The supervisor must parse tool-use requests from agents, execute the tool, and return the result to the agent for it to continue its generation process.
    *   Code execution must be sandboxed to prevent security risks.
*   **Implementation Notes:** Build a simple tool-use loop. For code execution, use a restricted environment or a separate, jailed process.

#### **Feature 4: Deliberation Layer**
*   **Description:** The mechanism for comparing agent outputs and forming a final consensus.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Must collect the final responses from all successful worker agents.
    *   Must apply a consensus algorithm. MVP: A supervisor agent prompts a high-level LLM (e.g., GPT-4o) to synthesize the inputs: `"Given the following responses from different AI agents, synthesize the best possible single answer. Responses: [agent1_output], [agent2_output], ..."`.
    *   The result of this synthesis will be the final answer.
*   **Implementation Notes:** This is a final, single API call made by the Supervisor after all workers have returned their individual responses.

#### **Feature 5: Output Aggregator**
*   **Description:** Compiles and presents the final response and provides transparency.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Must present the final, deliberated answer to the user via the CLI.
    *   Must support a `--verbose` flag to print the full deliberation log, including each agent's individual response.
    *   Must save the JSON deliberation log to a file for later analysis.

### **7. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Performance:** End-to-end latency for responses should be under 30 seconds for 3 agents on a standard query.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture must allow for adding a new agent by simply updating a configuration file (e.g., YAML).
*   **Security:** API keys must be loaded from environment variables. Code execution tools must be sandboxed.
*   **Reliability:** The system must be fault-tolerant to single-agent or API call failures. Implement a retry mechanism (e.g., 3 attempts) for API calls.
*   **Usability:** The CLI must be simple, with clear instructions and a `--help` command.
*   **Maintainability:** The code must be modular, with separate components for the supervisor, workers, and tools. Aim for 80% unit test coverage.
*   **Compatibility:** Must run on Python 3.10+ with no OS-specific dependencies.

    *   **API Calls:** `aiohttp`
    *   **Dependencies:** `requests` (as fallback or for simple tools), `python-dotenv` (for env vars).
*   **Data Flow:** Prompts and responses are passed as strings. Full logs are structured as JSON objects.

### **9. Risks and Mitigations**

*   **Risk:** High API costs from multiple parallel calls.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement token counters and a hard cap per query. Log costs for each run.
*   **Risk:** Context window overflow from long prompts or tool outputs.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a summarization function that is triggered when context exceeds 80% of a model's limit.
*   **Risk:** Inconsistent output formats from different models hindering deliberation.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use structured prompting to guide all agents toward a similar output format.
*   **Risk:** Race conditions or deadlocks in parallel code.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use `asyncio`'s structured concurrency patterns (e.g., `asyncio.gather`) to manage tasks cleanly.

### **10. Milestones**

*   **Week 1:** Setup repository, core Supervisor/Worker classes, and successful parallel API calls via `asyncio`.
*   **Week 2:** Implement basic tool integration (web search) and the tool-use loop.
*   **Week 3:** Build the deliberation layer (synthesis prompt) and the output aggregator. Test the end-to-end MVP flow.
*   **Week 4:** Write documentation (README.md), add comprehensive unit tests, and prepare for the initial open-source release on GitHub.


Of course. The current "Grok Heavy" system is an excellent foundation. To make it **better, cooler, and more effective**, you can evolve it from a simple parallel processing system into a truly dynamic and collaborative multi-agent organism.

Here are several tiers of improvements, from straightforward enhancements to more ambitious architectural changes.

---

### Tier 1: Enhance the Core Deliberation (Most Impactful)

The biggest opportunity for improvement lies in the "deliberation" process, which is currently just a one-shot synthesis. True deliberation involves debate and refinement.

#### 1. **Implement a Critique-Refine Loop (Structured Debate)**
Instead of just synthesizing the final answers, make the agents critique each other's work.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  **Round 1 (Current Flow):** All workers generate their initial response in parallel.
    2.  **Round 2 (Critique):** The Supervisor collects these responses and sends them *back* to all workers. The new prompt for each worker would be: `"Here is the original query: '{query}'. Here are the initial responses from your peer agents: {peer_responses}. Your own initial response was: {your_response}. Please critique the other responses and provide a revised, improved final answer based on this new information."`
    3.  **Final Synthesis:** The Supervisor takes the *revised* answers and feeds them into the synthesis LLM, which now has a much higher quality of input to work with.

*   **Why it's better:** This mimics a real-world brainstorming and peer-review process, forcing agents to confront alternative viewpoints, correct errors, and merge strengths.
*   **Code Changes:**
    *   In `supervisor.py`, modify `process_query` to add a second loop after `_execute_workers`.
    *   In `worker.py`, the `process_task` function would need to handle this new, more complex prompt.

#### 2. **Introduce Specialized Agent Roles**
Currently, all workers are generalists. Make them specialists to improve the division of labor.

*   **How it works:**
    *   In `config.yaml`, add a `role` to each agent (e.g., `Planner`, `Researcher`, `Critic`, `Synthesizer`).
    *   The Supervisor orchestrates them in a logical sequence.
        1.  The `Planner` agent receives the query and breaks it down into sub-tasks.
        2.  The `Researcher` agent executes the sub-tasks, heavily using tools (web search, code).
        3.  The `Synthesizer` agent takes the research and writes a comprehensive draft.
        4.  The `Critic` agent reviews the draft for flaws, biases, or missing information and suggests improvements.
        5.  The `Synthesizer` refines the draft based on the critique for the final answer.

*   **Why it's cooler:** It's a "virtual team" that mimics a professional workflow. This is a more sophisticated multi-agent pattern than simple parallelism.
*   **Code Changes:**
    *   `supervisor.py` needs a more complex orchestration logic instead of a simple `asyncio.gather`.
    *   `worker.py`'s system prompts (`_get_system_prompt`) would be tailored to each role.

---

### Tier 2: Advanced Architecture & Capabilities (The "Cool" Factor)

These changes make the system more dynamic, powerful, and impressive.

#### 3. **Dynamic Agent Spawning**
Instead of a fixed pool of workers, allow the Supervisor to create new agents on the fly for sub-tasks.

*   **How it works:** If the initial analysis shows a query is extremely complex (e.g., "Compare the economic policies of the US and China over the last 5 years and write a Python script to visualize the GDP growth"), the Supervisor could decide to spawn two temporary "Researcher" agents—one for the US and one for China—and a "Coder" agent for the script.

*   **Why it's cooler:** This makes the system feel intelligent and adaptive, scaling its own cognitive resources to fit the problem. It moves from a fixed team to a dynamic task force.
*   **Code Changes:**
    *   `supervisor.py` would need a `_spawn_agent` method and more advanced logic in `_analyze_query_complexity` to create agent "plans."

#### 4. **Self-Improving Toolset**
Allow agents to write their own tools.

*   **How it works:** An agent realizes it needs a specific function it doesn't have (e.g., a currency converter). It can use the `code_executor` tool to write the Python function, validate it, and then the `ToolExecutor` could dynamically register this new function as a usable tool for the remainder of the session.

*   **Why it's more effective:** The system learns and adapts its capabilities *within a single run*. This is a step towards autonomous problem-solving.
*   **Code Changes:**
    *   `tools.py`: The `ToolExecutor` would need a `register_new_tool` method.
    *   `worker.py`: The system prompt would need to be updated to inform the agent of this capability.

#### 5. **Add a Web UI with Live Streaming**
A command-line interface is functional, but a web UI is far more engaging.

*   **How to do it:** Use **Streamlit** or **Gradio**. These Python libraries make it incredibly easy to build a simple web front-end.
    *   Show the Supervisor's "thought process" in real-time.
    *   Create columns for each worker, streaming their individual responses as they come in.
    *   Display tool usage with icons (e.g., a 🌐 for web search, a 🐍 for code execution).
    *   Visualize the final deliberation and stream the final answer.

*   **Why it's cooler:** It provides a transparent, "behind-the-scenes" look at the multi-agent collaboration, which is visually impressive and helps users trust the process.
*   **Code Changes:**
    *   Create a new file, `app.py`.
    *   Refactor the supervisor and worker to use `async` generators (`yield`) to stream updates to the UI instead of returning one final result.

---

### Tier 3: Improve Effectiveness & Efficiency

These changes make the system cheaper, faster, and produce better outputs.

#### 6. **Strategic Model Selection**
Use different models for different jobs to optimize cost and quality. The current dynamic scaling only changes the *number* of agents, not their *type*.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  The Supervisor uses a cheap, fast model (like Claude 3 Haiku or Grok-mini) for the initial query analysis and planning.
    2.  For intensive research or generation, it uses the powerful `grok-3-mini-beta`.
    3.  For the final, crucial synthesis/deliberation step, it uses the most powerful and reliable model available (like `gpt-4o`).

*   **Why it's more effective:** You're not wasting expensive tokens on simple tasks. It's the AI equivalent of having a junior analyst do the legwork and a senior partner review the final report.
*   **Code Changes:**
    *   `supervisor.py`: The logic in `process_query` and `_deliberate` would need to be able to select and call different models for different stages.

#### 7. **Implement Smart Caching**
API calls, especially for tools, can be redundant and costly.

*   **How it works:** Implement a simple caching mechanism (e.g., a dictionary or a small SQLite database). Before executing a tool call like `web_search("latest AI news")`, check if the exact same call was made in the last `N` minutes. If so, return the cached result.

*   **Why it's more effective:** Drastically reduces API costs and speeds up response times for queries that require similar background research.
*   **Code Changes:**
    *   `tools.py`: Wrap the `execute_tool` method with a caching decorator or inline caching logic.

#### 8. **Persistent State and Memory**
The system is currently stateless. Giving it memory would be a game-changer for follow-up questions.

*   **How it works:**
    *   Save the final result and the key findings from the deliberation log to a simple database (like `SQLite`) linked to a `session_id`.
    *   When the user asks a follow-up question, the Supervisor can retrieve the context from the previous turn and include it in the prompt.

*   **Why it's better:** It enables true conversational interaction, allowing users to refine, correct, or build upon previous answers.
*   **Code Changes:**
    *   Introduce a new `memory.py` module to handle database interactions.
    *   `supervisor.py` and `main.py` would need to manage conversation sessions.

By implementing these ideas, you can transform Grok Heavy from a powerful proof-of-concept into a cutting-edge, highly effective, and genuinely "cool" multi-agent system.
